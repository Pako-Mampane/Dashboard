# Sales Performance Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard designed to track and visualise the performance of a sales team for a fictional AI tech company. It demonstrates skills in **data synthesis, preprocessing, and dashboard development** using Python and popular data science libraries(Streamlit, Pyplot etc).

---

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Automatically creates realistic sales data for demonstration purposes.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis and visualization.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A centralized interface for exploring sales performance metrics.  
- **Modular Design**: Each step (data generation, preprocessing, visualization) is separated for clarity and reusability.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ script.py            # Generates synthetic sales data
â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preparation
â”œâ”€â”€ app2.py              # Main entry point for the dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ ui_components        # Folder containing logic for all the tabs i
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
```
## Installation

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pako-Mampane/Dashboard.git
cd Dashboard
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Generate the synthetic data
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
2. Preprocess the data
   Open and run the Jupyter notebook: Preprocessing.ipynb
   
4. Launch the dashboard
   ```bash
   streamlit run app2.py
   ```
